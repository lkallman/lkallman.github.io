			As the leaves start to fall from the trees in Riverside Park, we find ourselves reaching for cozy layers and autumnal accessories in the hues of our favorite warm beverages. There’s the burnt orange of a pumpkin spice latte, the light caramel brown of a chai, or simply the classic black of a morning coffee. But what makes each fall season different from the last is the style in which we embody our favorite elements of the season.

				College students are probably fashion’s biggest fans of the athleisure trend.  Let’s be honest, we are tired and overworked, and therefore feel justified rolling out of bed and heading to class in our pajamas. When athleisure brands really took off, school hallways and shopping malls were quickly inundated by brightly colored, relaxed hoodies and bedazzled yoga pants.

Today’s options are both basic and fashionable, allowing one to dress down while also feeling chic. Shoppers can trade in their neon pieces for muted pull-overs, versatile tees, and hip street footwear. If you too feel yourself tempted to see what all the rage is about, here’s a roundup of some pieces to try and where you can snag them. <a href="kickinit.html" class="readmore">Read More</a>
