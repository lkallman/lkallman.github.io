			<p>
				The start of a new semester can bring with it schedule catastrophes, exam anxiety, and overwhelming extracurricular responsibilities. If you’re anything like me, you need an escape from campus every once in awhile, and preferably one that will help you unwind and detox from the stress of school. New York City’s buzzing music scene is here to the save the day with artists from a range of genres, all performing at some of the city’s most popular venues.

			<h1>Orchestral October</h1>
	<p>
	Celebrate new beginnings as you complete the first month of the semester with pop-princess Kesha on her revival tour at the Hammerstein Ballroom (October 9th and 10th). Located in Midtown, Hammerstein Ballroom will also host the indie rock band Kaleo this month, most well known for their hits “Way Down We Go” and “All The Pretty Girls” (October 21st). Make your way to Terminal 5 on West 56th for a range of musical genres, which this month include electronic music producer Mura Masa (October 12th), the dreamy Lana Del Rey (October 23rd and 24th), and the indie pop group Misterwives (October 25th). Halsey, an electropop artist who kills it live, will grace the stage of the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on October 13th. Or if you find yourself by Irving Plaza (located near Union Square) on October 28th, I highly recommend checking out the alternative rock group Bad Suns, whose hit “Cardiac Arrest” will be playing on loop in your head immediately.
</p>

<h1>Notes of November</h1>
<p>
	If November has you craving some rap music, head on over to Terminal 5 on the 10th to see Macklemore, or on the 13th to hear Tyler, The Creator; better yet, score yourself tickets to both! Also on Terminal 5’s lineup this month you’ll find indie pop Bleachers, the stage name of Jack Antonoff, a notable songwriter and record producer. Tracks like “Don’t Take The Money” and “I Wanna Get Better” will have you singing and dancing along. Back at Irving Plaza, there’s a trio of shows to keep an eye out for: Pop band JR JR will take the stage on the 4th, followed by the famous “Cool Kids”, indie pop band Echosmith on the 8th, and the rock band The Strumbellas on the 11th. And, if you’re in the city for Thanksgiving weekend, you can’t miss pop sensation Dua Lipa on her first solo tour. She’ll be blessing Hammerstein Ballroom with her “New Rules” on November 24th, and trust me, she’ll “Blow Your Mind”.

<h1>Dynamic December</h1>
	<p>
		Indie rock artist St. Vincent will have NYC dancing for two nights in a row at Kings Theatre in Brooklyn (December 2nd and 3rd). Those of us who were avid users of the app Vine might know Us The Duo, a pop duet who will treat us to a holiday evening of music on the 2nd at the Concert Hall at the NY Society for Ethical Culture. Brooklyn Steel, a venue which comes from the creators of Terminal 5 and the Bowery Ballroom, will feature the up and coming alternative rock group Wolf Alice on the 4th, while R&B artist SZA will take the stage for back to back shows on the 10th and 11th. Beacon Theatre, just a short trip from Barnard on the Upper West Side, will host the unique a cappella group Pentatonix for a trio of nights from December 19th-21st. Last, but not least, check out Jon Bellion, the hip hop artist and Long Island native, at Terminal 5 on the 21st. I promise, his infectious energy will distract you from the “All Time Low” of finals.
