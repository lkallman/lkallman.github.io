		<p>
			As students who live in New York City, one of the biggest fashion capitals of the world, we are constantly exposed to the hottest trends. From people we pass on the street to posts that we mindlessly scroll by, virtually everything around us leads to inspiration that we incorporate into our own personal fashion arsenals. In recent years we’ve seen a rise in the presence of fashion bloggers, and they serve as relatable role models to whom we look for fashion news and guidance. Here’s a round-up of a few NYC fashion bloggers to keep up with for an inside scoop on what’s in style and pointers on how you can channel your inner fashionista.

		<h1>Blair Eadie - Atlantic-Pacific - @blaireadiebee</h1>
<p>
	Blair Eadie is no newbie to the fashion scene, as she started as a merchandiser and has worked with various fashion and luxury brands since. Blair describes her style as “timeless meets classic with a hint of quirk” and I couldn’t agree more. In her ensembles you’ll find frequent touches of pink and modern takes on classic designs. She often wears jackets of traditional cuts that are livened up by rainbow stripes, cozy textures, or unique button details. In fact, Blair dedicates a page of her website to stripes, which I wholeheartedly support. She exhibits everything from the classic striped tee to a striped jacket and shorts set with retro vibes. No matter what Blair is wearing, she’s likely to flaunt a bold red lip and oversized sunglasses, establishing her personal style identity.

<h1>Jessica Steele - The Steele Maiden - @thesteelemaiden</h1>
<p>
	Next up in our fashion blog crawl is The Steele Maiden. Like the other bloggers featured, Jessica Steele resides in New York and showcases her unique style on our streets daily. Jessica’s style encompasses vintage vibes and often unexpected combinations. She’s not afraid to mix patterns, such as in a recent Instagram post where she pairs a leopard print dress with a pair of sheer black polka dot tights. Her unlikely ensembles and fun accessories, such as a red beret or hair bow, keep her looks fresh and young. Also, she recently rocked an emerald green jumpsuit which we should all add to our closets this holiday season.

<h1>Helena Glazer Hodne - Brooklyn Blonde - @brooklynblonde1</h1>
<p>
	Helena Glazer Hodne, otherwise known as Brooklyn Blonde, effortlessly embodies New York street style. She’s a businesswoman, a mother, and a wife, and she makes it all work. Her style communicates these roles, as it is sophisticated while remaining relatable. One day, she’s hitting the NYC streets in all black with a long camel colored coat and a pair of killer heeled booties. The next, she’s looking equally stylish on a family trip to Woodstock in ripped jeans, a classic cozy sweater, and a pair of flat loafers. Helena illustrates the fashion balance we all aim to strike, effortlessly transferring from the laidback weekend to the workweek hustle.

<h1>Katie Manwaring - Katie’s Bliss - @katiesbliss</h1>
<p>
	Katie Manwaring of Katie’s Bliss has mastered the fusion of classic prep with fashion forward NYC street style. Her fall looks are especially enviable, featuring plaids in autumnal hues, versatile vests, and cozy sweaters and blanket wraps. Katie often opts for warmer color palettes, frequently choosing brown over black when it comes to accessories. I admire this departure from the highly monochromatic tones for which New York is generally known, and I take it as a reminder that we don’t always have to dress “too cool” for color. A common thread through many of her looks is her effortless blonde waves and large aviator sunglasses, simultaneously giving off an easy going and polished vibe.
