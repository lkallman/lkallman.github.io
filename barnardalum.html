		<p>
			Over winter break, I was bombarded with questions about my first semester at college. Naturally, I responded with smiles and nods, hoping to skip the typical holiday small talk. Unfortunately, the question I couldn’t so easily avoid was “What’s your major?” I tried my best to make “Undecided” sound fresh and exciting, but to no avail. Just as my relative-turned-interrogator started to give up, I dazzled him or her with my non-academic major, celebrity stalking, and my favorite book from the semester, Lauren Graham’s Talking as Fast as I Can.

			<p>New York City draws celebrity stalkers like me from near and far, all hoping to catch a glimpse of their favorite stars and snap the perfect selfie for Instagram. Last semester alone, Barnard and Columbia found their walkways strutted down by some of our most admired figures. Take December 3rd, for example, when Barnard’s own Lauren Graham (‘88) blessed her alma mater with a discussion on her latest book and a viewing of her anxiously anticipated performance in the Gilmore Girls A Year In The Life revival.

		Graham is best known for her infectious portrayal of Lorelai Gilmore, but she excels in every role she takes on, whether it be on the screen or on the page. In November of 2016, Graham released her second book, titled Talking as Fast as I Can: From Gilmore Girls to Gilmore Girls (And Everything In Between). The work is a collection of essays, each given its own chapter with clever titles, my personal favorite being “Before My REI Card: Some Thoughts on Being Single.” The essays chronicle Graham’s time as a student/actor in NYC, the struggle to find steady jobs, and her constant battle with the condescending question, “Did you, um, make it?” (the answer to which is obvious to me). What might sound like the standard story of every hopeful teenager turned successful star is instead made incredibly unique thanks to Graham’s witty writing repertoire. She includes charming anecdotes about contemplating veganism to impress Ellen Degeneres and being the worst guest judge to ever step foot on the Project Runway set. To my fellow Gilmore Girls enthusiasts, prepare yourselves for a trip down memory lane as Graham recounts shooting the show through her diary, complete with candid photos and insight into the making of our favorite mother-daughter classic. Two hundred and twenty-four pages will fly by and leaving you wanting more of Graham’s inventive storytelling and luminous voice. No need to worry, as you can download the audiobook on your phone and take Lauren’s adventure and personal narration with you wherever you go.

	I highly recommend that everyone read this hilariously honest book, and that they pass it on to someone else. I recommended it to each relative I talked to over break, immediately after I finished telling them about my favorite celebrity stalking experience from last semester: the day that I spent twelve hours downtown waiting for Lauren Graham to speak about her latest endeavor at a local bookstore. Complete with a signed copy of the book and a photo-op, the barely thirty-minute experience was worth all the wait. And of course, I can’t complain about the added perk of a record number of likes on Instagram. But one photo wasn’t enough, so my friends and I eagerly awaited her arrival outside the Barnard gates the following night. Graham was kind and humble, and even delayed her entrance to take just one more photo with us. In the short moments that we shared with Lauren over this unbeatable weekend, we found ourselves beaming and gushing, and talking as fact as we could.
