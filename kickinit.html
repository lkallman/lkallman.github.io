			<p>
				College students are probably fashion’s biggest fans of the athleisure trend.  Let’s be honest, we are tired and overworked, and therefore feel justified rolling out of bed and heading to class in our pajamas. When athleisure brands really took off, school hallways and shopping malls were quickly inundated by brightly colored, relaxed hoodies and bedazzled yoga pants. Now, the arrival of numerous streetwear brands and collections have replaced the athleisure trend, increasing the temptation to embrace a combination of comfort and style. Today’s options are both basic and fashionable, allowing one to dress down while also feeling chic. Shoppers can trade in their neon pieces for muted pull-overs, versatile tees, and hip street footwear. If you too feel yourself tempted to see what all the rage is about, here’s a roundup of some pieces to try and where you can snag them.

			<h1>Top It Off</h1>
	<p>
		Out with the Abercrombie graphic t-shirts, and in with today’s equivalent: basic logo tees and contemporary crewneck sweatshirts. The most popular versions are those by Supreme or KITH, which boast their logos loud and proud, but their prices can run high. For an alternative, check out Urban Outfitters or H&M for simple and less pricey tops. While you’re at it, invest in a versatile and sporty bomber jacket, which will help you achieve the rebellious NYC look we’re all secretly trying to attain. To turn the heads of everyone on the street, get yourself a bomber from Zendaya’s new Daya line, available online. Hers comes in a deep blue and features a screen-printed graphic on the back. While you’re at it, take a peek at her patchy anorak jacket and cut off sweatshirts. For cheaper bomber jackets, scope out the scales rack at Zara or order from the online shop Missguided.

<h1>No Sequins Necessary</h1>
	<p>
		Bedazzled yoga pants aren’t yet extinct, but you can comfortably hit the streets without blinding every taxi driver that passes. If black jeans are the new blue jeans, then black spandex leggings are the new yoga pants. Slip into a pair of these sleek bottoms for a study session, babysitting gig, or a late night trip downtown. High quality options are available from sports retailers such as Nike or upscale brands like Aritzia. However, help your wallet by scoring yourself a pair from Forever 21’s activewear line. If you’re feeling courageous, opt for a pair with mesh cutouts or a colorblock design. Score yourself a few pairs in muted tones for a seasonal yet subtle look, or embrace your sporty side and check out Adidas’ iconic style with three stripes running down the leg.

<h1>These Shoes are Made for Walking...and Fashion</h1>
<p>
	Barnard students consider the entirety of NYC to be our campus. As much as we love our heels and booties, they are not always the most practical when exploring the city. Enter streetwear, and its multitude of stylish and supportive footwear. Purchasing a pair of such sneakers will be one of the best decisions you make this year, I promise. You don’t have to be the millionth person with a pair of black and white Adidas Superstars to participate in this trend. Venture beyond this popular style and try out a pair of Adidas’ NMD or Stan Smith sneakers. The Stan Smiths feature the same retro vibe as the Superstars but are slightly more refreshing, and the NMD sneakers more resemble a running shoe while maintaining a casual everyday look. If you dream to emulate Rihanna, take a peek at her platform Creepers, made by Puma. Although such brands can be on the higher end of the price spectrum, the quality makes them worth the splurge. Trust me, your feet will be thanking you when you’re waiting 3 hours for your favorite band or walking 20 blocks to save yourself the $2.75 subway fare.
